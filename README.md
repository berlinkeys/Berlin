# Berlin Keyboard

***Important: This is a development branch of the keyboard. While in theory the PCB should work, something weird stuff called impedance and inductance always tries to mess up your projects. Also you wouldn't want this catching fire due to improper trace widths, would you? This is only v0.7 and due for a complete redesign. Don't be dumb, do not use this in prod (also not in testing for it is badly engineered).***

## Introduction
Berlin is a 120% Keyboard based on the design of the [Boston](https://github.com/bluepylons/Boston) keyboard. 
It has a lot of programmable Keys, runs QMK and all in all does everything you would like a keyboard to do.
It also features a big Display over the Numpad to enable more functions, like internal macros, status screens and custom graphics.

## The Inspiration for the Keyboard came directly from the Boston Keybaord. 
However, we wanted at least a 100% keyboard, including all the random keys only shady developers use.
Thats when we started redesigning the Boston, as it is both a good open source keyboard and a good starting point.
Dead space was never an option, so why not add an LCD instead of LED Indicators...

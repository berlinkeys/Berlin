# Berlin Keyboard

## Introduction
Berlin is a 120% Keyboard based on the design of the [Boston](https://github.com/bluepylons/Boston) keyboard. 
It has a lot of programmable Keys, runs QMK and all in all does everything you would like a keyboard to do.
It also features a big Display over the Numpad to enable more functions, like internal macros, status screens and custom graphics.

## The Inspiration for the Keyboard came directly from the Boston Keybaord. 
However, we wanted at least a 100% keyboard, including all the random keys only shady developers use.
Thats when we started redesigning the Boston, as it is both a good open source keyboard and a good starting point.
Dead space was never an option, so why not add an LCD instead of LED Indicators...

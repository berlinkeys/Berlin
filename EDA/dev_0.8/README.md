# 0.8 dev version of PCB

***Important: This is a development branch of the keyboard. While in theory the PCB should work, something weird stuff called impedance and inductance always tries to mess up your projects. Also you wouldn't want this catching fire due to improper trace widths, would you? This is only v0.7 and due for a complete redesign. Don't be dumb, do not use this in prod (also not in testing for it is badly engineered).***

This directory will eventually contain a redesign of the entire PCB also taking into account electromechanical considerations and PCB design best practices. It is still only v0.8 and currently a mirror of 0.7. This is likely the first version to be physically prototyped.

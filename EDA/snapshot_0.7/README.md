# 0.7 dev version of PCB

***Important: This is a development branch of the keyboard. While in theory the PCB should work, something weird stuff called impedance and inductance always tries to mess up your projects. Also you wouldn't want this catching fire due to improper trace widths, would you? This is only v0.7 and due for a complete redesign. Don't be dumb, do not use this in prod (also not in testing for it is badly engineered).***

This directory is meant as a backup for the 0.7 version of the PCB. When the development on this version is complete, this will be deprecated and moved to branch ahead0.7.
